-----PROGRESS----

COMPELETED: 
Stage 1 (initiation): 
-Initiated Data Structures
-Declared Structures

IN-PROGRESS:
Stage 2 (set_cell_value function): 
-Created template
-Must focus on storing the values in the underlying data structure now
-Important that we are working with a copy of the text input into the function which is then freed
-The functions can be stored in the data structure since that plays no impact on what text is displayed (atleast not yet) 
-DO NOT free the text_copy in the set_cell_value because it is still being used by the 2D array by the pointers, it must be freed when the function for clearing the cell is called
